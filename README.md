# 🐍🎲 Snakes and Ladders Game in Python

A simple **2-player Snakes and Ladders** game built using Python, designed to run in the console. This classic board game was created to practice Python fundamentals like functions, loops, conditionals, and randomization.

## 🚀 Features

- 6x6 game board (36 blocks)
- Two-player gameplay
- Dice roll simulation with random numbers (1–6)
- Snakes that bring you down 🐍
- Ladders that lift you up 🪜
- Win detection and board visualization

## 🎯 Game Rules

- Players start at block 0
- On each turn, roll the dice (1–6) to move forward
- Landing on a ladder moves you up to a higher block
- Landing on a snake takes you back to a lower block
- First to reach block 36 wins

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python functions and control structures
- `random` module for dice roll simulation
- Lists to manage player positions and board
- ASCII-based board and player display
- Color-coded console output using ANSI escape codes

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anilvasy/Snake-and-Ladder-in-Python/blob/main/README.md

💡 Learning Outcome
-Built a complete turn-based board game in Python
-Practiced modular programming using functions
-Gained experience with terminal-based game logic
-Improved understanding of Python basics and user interaction
